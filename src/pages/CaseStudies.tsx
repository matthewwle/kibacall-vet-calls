      logo: "üêæ",
      challenge: "Happy Paws was losing an average of 23 calls per day during peak hours (7-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 5-7 PM). Their two-person front desk was overwhelmed, leading to 15-minute hold times and frustrated pet owners. Many clients were calling competitors when they couldn't get through.",
      solution: "Kibacall integrated seamlessly with their Covetrus practice management system to handle overflow calls 24/7. The AI collects pet information, books routine appointments, and escalates emergencies immediately to the on-call veterinarian. Automated SMS reminders reduced no-shows by sending appointment confirmations and pre-visit forms.",

      logo: "üè•",
      challenge: "As a smaller practice, Riverbend struggled with after-hours calls and weekend emergencies. Clients often called multiple times trying to reach someone, and the practice was losing potential new clients who needed immediate scheduling for sick pets.",
      solution: "Kibacall provides true 24/7 coverage, handling routine scheduling, medication refill requests, and triaging urgent cases. The system connects directly to their eVetPractice software and sends detailed call summaries to the veterinarians each morning. Emergency protocols ensure critical cases reach the on-call vet within 2 minutes.",

      challenge: "With three locations across Chicago, City Pet Care struggled with consistent phone coverage and appointment coordination. Different locations had varying wait times, and clients were frustrated when they couldn't get same-day appointments at their preferred location.",
      solution: "Kibacall manages calls for all three locations simultaneously, intelligently routing appointments based on availability, pet type, and client preferences. The system integrates with Hippo Manager to provide real-time scheduling across all locations and automatically sends appointment reminders with location-specific instructions.",
